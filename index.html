          <p>
            I have been working in IT for two and a half years.
            Before this I was working admin at Lloyds Banking Group. Changing my career was a big step
            But choosing IT as that career was easy. I enjoyed helping people with their computer issues at Lloyds,
            although my knowledge base was very limited at the time. IT is something I thought I would get a lot
            of satisfaction out of, as well as expand and grow as a person within the field.
